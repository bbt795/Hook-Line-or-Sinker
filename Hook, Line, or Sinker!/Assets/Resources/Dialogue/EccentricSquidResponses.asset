  dialogue:
  - Good morrow! Our paths have crossed and its a pleasure to finally meet you.
  - The song of my soul is calling me elsewhere...
  - Praytell, for your artist of choice, who ignites the creative spark in your soul?
  - I see your soul is easily swayed by the masses.
  - My hearts never quite resonated with her.
  - His art has been the inspiration for many great pieces.
  - Your taste in art defies the Squid Pro Quo.
  - If you could paint your lifes story, what colors would dominate the canvas?
  - The most passionate and basic color to ever grace the rainbow.
  - It represents both everything and nothing, and that's something I relate to.
  - Like the lush seaweed whos embrace hints at a natural high and an earthly ecstasy.
  - An overwhelming color that plagues my life. I can never escape its constant presence.
  - To bring our amorous meeting to a close, what would you title this fateful encounter?
  - It's because I'm a squid isn't it.
  - A vast and unfathomable prison that confines my soul eternally to its greedy
    depths. Such a cruel fate...
  - Forbidden love is the bittersweet melody that transcends barriers to reveal that
    love knows boundaries.
  - Our chemistry gives me hope that a dreamer like myself can break free from a
    prison once thought impossible.
  - We must be soulmates, there is no such thing as a coincidence in the pursuit
    of love!
  - I'll ink about a future encounter, give me some time to swim through the currents
    of inspiration.
  - Regrettably, the tides of fate have pushed us in opposite directions, we were
    not meant to be.

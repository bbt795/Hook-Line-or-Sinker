  dialogue:
  - Good evening, my dear. Thank you for inviting me to a such a lovely place.
  - Sorry, it seems like I'm needed elsewhere...
  - Let's get to know each other better! What's your favorite color?
  - A classic!
  - Can't say I feel the same...
  - That's a good choice.
  - That's my favorite, too! What a coincidence.
  - If you suddenly won a million dollars, what would you do, my dear?
  - A wise investment!
  - That doesn't sound very financially stable...
  - How selfless of you, you must have a heart of gold!
  - Sounds fun! I wonder what sights you'll see.
  - Last question, my dear! Do you believe in destiny?
  - I feel the same! Wow, I've never met anyone who is just as hopelessly romantic
    as me.
  - Oh... I see. How disappointing...
  - Are you still thinking about that 1 million?
  - I guess that makes sense...
  - Your eyes sparkle like stars, your smile lights up my heart. I've fallen for
    you, hopelessly and completely. We must be sweethearts, made for each other.
    Will you be mine, sweetheart?
  - I had such a lovely date with you, my dear. Perhaps we will see each other again,
    if fate allows.
  - Sorry, I don't think we're meant to be. True love will find us eventually, just
    not if we're together.

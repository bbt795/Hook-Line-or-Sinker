  - Nice to meet you, thank you for taking me to dinner!
  - Oh...
  - So, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?
  - Omg! Me too! We have so much in common!
  - Um...interesting...*awkward fish smile*
  - Can't say I've ever done it.
  - How, original.
  - Ok! Next question! What's your favorite food?
  - '*Date end here*'
  - I had a friend in high school who used to do that.
  - So you're vegan! I am too! :D
  - I don't think I know what grilled means...
  - Last question! Which artist/group do you like most?
  - '"I hear them all the time on FinTok!'
  - I've heard of him, seems nice.
  - Ugh, I can't stand rap
  - I've heard good things, but they never landed with me.
  - I think this went swimmingly! I'd love to get to know you more! What do you think?
  - This was a nice date, gimme some fin! Oh, nevermind, uh, same time next week?
  - I wouldn't be caught dead with you, don't contact me
